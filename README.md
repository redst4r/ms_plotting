# ms_plotting

A few functions for common, but complex plotting operations
- Tiling many images into a single big image
- visualize images on 2D scatter plots (i.e. plot the MNIST digits on top a PCA of MNIST)
- scatterplots: colors and markers combined, scattermatrices, pairwise relationsships of datapoints
